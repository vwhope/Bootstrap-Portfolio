# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Vicki Hope - Bootstrap-Portfolio
This repository exercise shows how using Twitter Bootstrap can standardize the look and feel of a website
as well as reduce the custom CSS elements required for the theme. 

Compare this repo to Basic-Portfolio repo which does not use BootStrap - to see the difference.
